# noisechatter
Noisechatter is an extension of the Noisebridge BBS. It's meant to complement other features of the BBS by providing a sidechannel for chatters using a Javascript web application using Node.js and Socket.io.

This repo uses James Q. Quick's code from his 8 part tutorial, "Design and Build a Chat App with Socket.io." The link to the playlist is <a href="http://iteroni.com/playlist?list=PLDlWc9AfQBfbyGwhSlxg16mQGpGnauCwq" target=_blank> here.</a>

This is a great series and I highly recommend it. This code should work on localhost:3000, but is not recommended as a solution for production level chat apps. I'm still modifying the code and trying to make it fit my use case.

Feel free to fork if you like. This is one of my first repos, so I assure you I will mess something up. :)
