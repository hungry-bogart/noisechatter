# noisechatter
Noisechatter is an extension of the Noisebridge BBS. It's meant to complement other features of the BBS by providing a sidechannel for chatters using a Javascript web application using Node.js and Socket.io.

This repo uses James Q. Quick's code from his 8 part tutorial, "Design and Build a Chat App with Socket.io." The link to the playlist is <a href="http://iteroni.com/playlist?list=PLDlWc9AfQBfbyGwhSlxg16mQGpGnauCwq" target=_blank> here.</a> This is a great series and I highly recommend it.
